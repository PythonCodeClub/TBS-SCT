# Original Pilot Project from April 18 2018
IMTD will be hosting a free 6-week pilot project for data scientists using TBS’s unclassified cloud environment.
Consider joining the pilot project for TBS’s data science workbench and offer your feedback!
# Objective
The pilot is a fact-finding project to determine the strengths and weaknesses of selected tools that are part of TBS’s data science workbench.

# What will you do?
We’re looking for 10 data scientists from any sector of TBS. Participants will have access to a Windows or Linux server on the cloud. There will be equal numbers of participants testing the tools on Windows and Linux

More than 10 tools will be tested, including Anaconda, PowerBI, R, Python, SQL and Visual Studio. The results will be used to finalize decisions on implementing these tools.
Reasons:

## What now?

We now will have the Python Code Club be a lunch hour session in which this Pilot Project can be used a community, and collaborative space to speak with other Data Scientists and learn from them.

I will try to have a detailed outline, but on top of my work. I will most likely do ad-hoc explanations and get the feel from the rest of the crowd.

### Week 1, Meet up and Introductions who are we?

Introduction was on the 6th floor. To generate interest, and it was fun. We did simple discussion of the simple environment. There are a lot of barries of entry.
* Discussion points:
*   Anaconda
*   Python
*   How to get this stuff installed?
*   Git, What is it?

### Week 2, Discussion about Pandas, Requests, and BS4 for the use case of Web Scraping. 

_Python_ and **Web Scraping** on the 2nd floor. We had a smaller group. We wanted to discuss Python and how to `extract` data off websites. A lot of interest, but no environment set-up. 
* Discussion Points
*   How to make faster process?
*   More demo time
*   Explain more thoroughly.

### Week 3, Mailing List creating using Pandas.

We worked on attempting to make a mailing list text information. The idea was to gather information from the e-mail list that was generated from outlook.
We focused on using a python package called Pandas to help with data analysis, with importing the text string as csv, then parsing it.
* Discussion points:
*   Quickly browsed data frames
*   How to split text strings to seperate information
*   Required review of data types and information types for Python.



## Week 4, TBD. Doodle Poll

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

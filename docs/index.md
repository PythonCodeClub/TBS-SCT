### Week 1, Meet up and Introductions who are we?

Week 1 Introduction was on the 6th floor. To generate interest, and it was fun. We did simple discussion of the simple environment. There are a lot of barries of entry. Discussion points:
*   Anaconda
*   Python
*   How to get this stuff installed?
*   Git, What is it?

### Week 2, 

Week 2 Python and Web Scraping on the 2nd floor. We had a smaller group. We wanted to discuss Python and how to extract data off websites. A lot of interest, but no environment set-up. Discussion points:
*   How to make faster process?
*   More demo time
*   Explain more thoroughly.

### Week 3, Mailing List creationg using Pandas.

Today, we worked on attempting to make a mailing list text information. The idea was to gather information from the e-mail list that was generated from outlook.
We focused on using a python package called Pandas to help with data analysis, with importing the text string as csv, then parsing it.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

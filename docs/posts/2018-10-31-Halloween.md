Today, an MP from Willowdale Ontario, Toronto. Ali Ehsassi presented a statement about Filipino heritage and how the Filipino Canadian community is a growing population of immigrants in Canada. According to the 2016 Census from Statistics Canada, there are 800,000 people of Filipino descent living in Canada. Filipinos are the fastest growing communities in Canada, representing 27% population growth since 2011.
As a Filipino Canadian, I'm happy to hear that our community is being mentioned and recognized during question period. I'm proud to be a Filipino Canadian living in Canada, and able to hear the about statistics that represent my heritage, our community, and my identity here in Canada. I'm blessed and thankful to be living here in this Country. I am very grateful to Statistics Canada having worked there for 3 years as an FSWEP Student. I was given the opportunity to learn and grow as an individual and develop essential work and life skills while earning a living. I recognize the importance of quality data about Canadians and getting this information to Canadians.

Thank you Statistics Canada for providing an awesome environment to work,and to every public servant, I have had the chance to work with, interact with, and communicate with. You all have all had a lifelong impact on my life.

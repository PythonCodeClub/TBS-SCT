== Open Data Science ==
Data science does not require the use of super computers, or expensive employee training or software.  There are many open source tools available that provide the same functionality and training as their expensive proprietary alternatives.  The following table includes some of the open data science tools and their usage across the GC:

|[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/r-server Microsoft R]
|'''Microsoft R''' is a collection of packages, interpreters, and infrastructure for developing and deploying R-based machine learning and data science solutions on a range of platforms, from local standalone installations on Linux and Windows, to large distributed deployments on node clusters.

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/r-server/what-is-microsoft-r-server '''R Server'''] is the flagship product and supports very large workloads in the enterprise.

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/r-server/r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client '''R Client'''] is a free workstation version. It includes the same R Server functionality, but for local workloads.

[https://mran.microsoft.com/open/ '''R Open'''] is Microsoft's distribution of open source R, without the proprietary packages and infrastructure of our other products. This R distribution is included in both Microsoft R Client and R Server.

Note: R Open is important in order to leverage [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/machine-learning Microsoft's ML algorithms that are available in Azure] and R Server is important for scaling out R commands.

|Included in SQL Server license. Upcoming SQL Server 2017  will include Python and Microsoft will rename their "R Server" to "[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rserver/2017/08/01/machine-learning-services-in-sql-server-2017/ Microsoft Machine Learning Services]"

|[https://www.rstudio.com R Studio Desktop]
|RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.
|Works well as an IDE to the Microsoft R Client.

|[http://jupyter.org/ Jupyter] (open source)
|The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
|Recommended to be installed on Anaconda. Python is default but R is available.
